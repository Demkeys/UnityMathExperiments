# UnityMathExperiments
Various experiments that I do in Unity when I learn about any math algorithm. For the most part you'll usually find C# scripts here, not complete Unity projects, but I'll try my best to include detailed instructions for how to use each script. These scripts are meant to be used in the __Unity Game Engine__.
